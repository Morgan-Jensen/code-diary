# All About My Code Diary
### Who, What, and Why?


##### **About The Author**

My name is Morgan Jensen. I am a Computer Scientist. I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science, majoring in computer science, from Weber State Universitiy in August of 2020. I currently work in industry and will soon return to get my master's degree. I plan to return to school in September of 2021. For most of my internship and current career I have worked developing desktop applications using the .NET Framework, specifically WPF.

##### **The Goals**

1. As a computer scientist, I want to keep track of what I have learned. 
	* I am recently graduated, and in the 3 years or so I spent doing computer science, I have learned so much. I want to keep a record of what I have learned and continue to learn throughout my career. It may come in handy sometime, and who knows, maybe it will just be fun to look back on.
2. As a professional developer, I want to improve my programming skills. 
	* I believe that having some sort of accountability to something other than just myself will help encourage me to learn more and try new things.
3. As a programmer, I want to have a project that I care about. 
	* For some time, I have been trying to come up with some sort of project that I can really care about, and use to learn new things. I think that this diary will allow me to learn all kinds of new things, and find value in what I learn and do.
4. As someone who wants to learn more, I want to share with others what I have learned.
	* The final product (though I don't know if it will ever really be FINAL) I want to shoot for is a record of things I have learned that I can share with teammates and fellow students.

##### **The Rules**

_The Rules:_
1. All entries must be made in markdown.
	* There are a few reasons for this. First, I know very little about markdown going into this, so it will give me something new to learn right off the bat. In addition to being new to me, it is portable, versitile, future-proof, platform-independant, and most importanlty (right now anyway) is that it is easily converted into HTML (more on that in _The Plan_). 
2. Anything new that can be documented, should be. 
	* Whenever I learn a new framework or technology, it should be an obvious target for a diary entry. However, I also want to include smaller things like tips and tricks that I pick up with experience.
3. VIM must be used whenever possible for writing the diary entries.
	* I just want to learn how to use and get comfortable with VIM. No other reason really.
	* Plug-ins / add-ons are allowed. 
4. I do not have to know everything about what I am writing about before writing it.
	* I plan on keeping some records while trying to learn things. This will give me a record of my thoughts while learning the material, as well as give anyone who reads it some insite into what I did to learn it.

These rules are subject to change or be added to as I learn more. I do not, however, want to remove rules just because they are a bit difficult.

##### **The Plan**

The end goal is to hopefully build my own web interface to publish this diary. I don't see it happening too soon, but that is the end idea.
