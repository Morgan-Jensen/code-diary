# All About My Code Diary
### Who, What, and Why?

##### **The Backstory**

Unfortunately, I am a bit of a Reddit addict. I spend way too long looking at some of the dumbest things on the internet. In an attempt to "smarten-up" my time online, I subscribed to the subreddit r/programming. I then proceeded to ignore it every time it appeared in my feed. By sheer luck, I happened to pay attention to one of the posts scrolling by with a video about keeping a code diary. I have recently been thinking about doing some kind of diary to catalog what I do. This seemed like something I might be interested in. During a break at work, I decided to watch the video (note to self: link video here - done by channel Semicolon&Sons). It was nothing like I thought it was going to be. First of all, the guy was using VIM, which I have little experience in, and at the time, little interest in using. Second, it wasn't a record of my day-to-day stuff, just programming information. Honestly, I didn't think it sounded like something I would be interested in. Over the next few days, I started to think more and more about it. I started thinking about all the stuff I would include if I were to keep a code diary, and thinking that it would be a pretty cool thing to do. I of course had (and have) doubts about if it would be any good or useful, and thought "meh... it'll probably be trash". Then I remembered some advice I had heard from another video (link to day9 video about making something creative) where the creator talked about making something creative. He said, that the only way go get good at making something creative was to just do it. So here I am... just doing it. It might be hot garbage, but it will get better with time and practice (at least I hope so). So here it is. My attempt at documenting and sharing what I know and learn about programming.

##### **About The Author**

My name is Morgan Jensen. I am a Computer Scientist. I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science, majoring in computer science, from Weber State Universitiy in August of 2020. I currently work in industry and will soon return to get my master's degree. I plan to return to school in September of 2021. My career has been a bit unique, in that, while still an intern, I, at different points during the 2 years I interned, was made a product owner (twice), a team lead, a project architect, and a recruiter on top of being a normal developer. Often my customers had no idea of what they wanted, and it fell to my team and I to figure it out. I have a bit of experience in everything from my classes, but most of my time programming has been using the .NET framework; specifically WPF.

I am not the smartest guy around, nor do I claim to be. I am still unexperienced compared to many others at my age, and I have a long way to go, but I am going to give this code diary my best shot!

##### **The Goals**

I figure I better start with what I want to achieve with my code diary.

1. As a computer scientist, I want to keep track of what I have learned. 
	* I am recently graduated, and in the 3 years or so I spent doing computer science, I have learned so much. I want to keep a record of what I have learned and continue to learn throughout my career. It may come in handy sometime, and who knows, maybe it will just be fun to look back on.
2. As a professional developer, I want to improve my programming skills. 
	* I believe that having some sort of accountability to something other than just myself will help encourage me to learn more and try new things.
3. As a programmer, I want to have a project that I care about. 
	* For some time, I have been trying to come up with some sort of project that I can really care about, and use to learn new things. I think that this diary will allow me to learn all kinds of new things, and find value in what I learn and do.
4. As someone who wants to learn more, I want to share with others what I have learned.
	* The final product (though I don't know if it will ever really be FINAL) I want to shoot for is a record of things I have learned that I can share with teammates and fellow students. Gotta reach back right?

##### **The Rules**

Ok. I am going to lay down some ground rules to make this more interesting for myself, and keep it from just being something I keep in a .txt file on my computer somewhere.

_The Rules:_
1. All entries must be made in markdown.
	* There are a few reasons for this. First, I know very little about markdown going into this, so it will give me something new to learn right off the bat. In addition to being new to me, it is portable, versitile, future-proof, platform-independant, and most importanlty (right now anyway) is that it is easily converted into HTML (more on that in _The Plan_). 
2. Anything new that can be documented, should be. 
	* Whenever I learn a new framework or technology, it should be an obvious target for a diary entry. However, I also want to include smaller things like tips and tricks that I pick up with experience.
3. VIM must be used whenever possible for writing the diary entries.
	* I just want to learn how to use and get comfortable with VIM. No other reason really.
	* Plug-ins / add-ons are allowed. 
4. I do not have to know everything about what I am writing about before writing it.
	* I plan on keeping some records while trying to learn things. This will give me a record of my thoughts while learning the material, as well as give anyone who reads it some insite into what I did to learn it.

These rules are subject to change or be added to as I learn more. I do not, however, want to remove rules just because they are a bit difficult.

##### **The Plan**

Forturnately for me, I will have plenty of time to learn about computer science. With grad-school fast approaching, I think that transcribing the things that I learn into the diary will be a great opportunity for me, to both better understand what I learn, and give me a space to critically think about the topics. I also think that my "lowest common denominator" rule will help me make sure I understand what I am talking about. If I can't explain it for someone who knows less than I do, then I don't really understand it that well. I also get plenty of opportunity to try new things at my place of employment. I think adding that information to the diary could be helpful for me and coworkers in the future. I hope that this record will also inspire me to try and learn more about the things that interest me.

The end goal is to hopefully build my own web interface to publish this diary. I don't see it happening too soon, but that is the end idea.

##### **In Conclusion**

Well, that is all I can think to include in the intro. Fingers crossed that this goes well and I don't give up or forget about it within a few weeks.

Oh and to anyone who reads this, forgive its imperfections. I'm just a dude trying something new. That goes for future me reading this too ;P
